//// ðŸ‘† that is now the server alredy listening.
// we need to do next, is to define routs. but we actually created Routes in a  Node-farm project but in express it works differently.

/////// ---COMMENTS---///

//http is a method which is used for that(here that request means the request made by the url of the router) request
// Routing means to determine how an application response to certain "clint" request so to a certain url. So its not just a url but also the http "method(get)" which is used for that request
///-->app.get('/');
//1)app then the http method we want to respond(.get) and then url(i,e root here).
//2) when someone hit that url with a "get" request. So what ever we want to use that we need to specify in a callback function as a second parameter

//res
//.status(200)
//.json({ message: 'Hello from the server side!', app: 'Natours' });
//}); By using this .json method here this will automatically set our contet type to application json(but we did it manually in the "node-form" project when we creatd our first api but we also send back some json  )
